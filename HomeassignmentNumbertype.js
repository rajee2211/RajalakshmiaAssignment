//Create a JavaScript function that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero and returns a 
//corresponding string indicating the type.

//Hints to Solve:  
//Use a conditional statement to check the number type. If the given number is greater than 0, it is a positive 
//number and if the given number is less than 0, it is a negative number. If the given number is 0, then the 
//number is neutral. 

let num=-11
if(num>0){
    console.log("Given number is postive numer : "+" "+num)
}else if(num==0){
   console.log("Given number is Neutral : "+" "+num)
} else{
    console.log("Given number is Negative number : "+" "+num)
