//Write a JavaScript function named `isOddOrEven` that takes an integer as input and returns `Odd` if the 
//number is odd and `"Even"` if the number is even. 

//Hints to solve
//Use an operator that checks divisibility by 2 for evenness, and apply a conditional statement to return "Even" 
//or "Odd".
